== Overview ==

A class of language models that use deep-learning algorithms and are trained on extremely large textual datasets that can be multiple terabytes in size. LLMs can be classed into two types: generative or discriminatory. Generative LLMs are models that output text, such as the answer to a question or even writing an essay on a specific topic. They are typically unsupervised or semi-supervised learning models that predict what the response is for a given task. Discriminatory LLMs are supervised learning models that usually focus on classifying text, such as determining whether a text was made by a human or AI.
