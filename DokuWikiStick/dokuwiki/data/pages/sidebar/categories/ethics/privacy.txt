=== AI Risks ===

== Data Breaches and Unauthorized Access ==
AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, increasing the potential for data breaches. This risk is immediate and ongoing, as cybercriminals continuously target AI-powered systems to access sensitive information.<sup>4</sup>

== Surveillance and Monitoring ==
Facial recognition and other AI-powered surveillance technologies raise concerns about privacy in public spaces. This risk is already present and likely to intensify in the coming years.<sup>4</sup>

== Unintended Data Exposure ==
Even small, proprietary AI models can inadvertently leak personal information. For example, a healthcare company's AI-powered diagnostic app might unintentionally share customer data with other users.<sup>5</sup>

== Data Collection Without Consent ==
AI systems may collect and use personal data without explicit user consent, as seen in recent controversies with social media platforms. This is an ongoing risk that is likely to persist in the medium term.<sup>5</sup>

== Inference and Profiling ==
Advanced AI analytics can infer sensitive information about individuals, even those not directly using the system. This medium-term risk could lead to privacy violations through unexpected data correlations.<sup>5</sup>

=== County-Specific Information ===

== County of Santa Clara Privacy Office ==
